    <!--
    ATM there's no way to allow certain sheets for actors of a type, because Foundry doesn't support
    multiple actor types and we're tricking it more or less. If the user selects an invalid sheet, we
    should simply display an error and ask them to swap the sheet. Ideally we can find a way around
    this boilerplate. We might decide to just do one template that does a case by case branch to the
    right template.
